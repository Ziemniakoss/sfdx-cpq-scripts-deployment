# WIP sfdx-cpq-scripts-deployment

Unofficial plugin for custom cpq scrips management.

Custom cpq scripts managed by this plugin are stored in customCpqScripts directory in root folder of sfdx project (the one with sfdx-project.json).
Each script has its own folder with:

-   index.js containing actual script and
-   package.json containing with configuration

Plugins generated by this plugin also have index.d.ts file contating typings for api models.

## How to use

### Create new cpq plugin

Run in directory contained in sfdx-project:

```cmd
sfdx cpq-scripts:generate
```

### Deploy cpq script

Run:

```cmd
sfdx cpq-scripts:deploy nameOfscript otherScript andSoOn
```

To deploy all scripts, use

```cmd
sfdx cpq-scripts:deploy --all
```

## TODO

- compile js to reduce size?
